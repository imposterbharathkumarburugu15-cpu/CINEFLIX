CineFlix is a React-based web application I built to showcase my skills in modern web development. It’s designed as a cinema booking and movie review platform, where users can explore the latest films, check ratings, and experience a smooth booking flow — all in one place.

I created CineFlix not just as a fun project, but also as a way to practice building real-world, user-focused applications. The goal was to combine clean UI design with solid functionality, making it both visually appealing and practical.</h3>
